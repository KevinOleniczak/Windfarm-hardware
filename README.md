# Windfarm Demo Hardware

### Purpose:
This hardware design is intended to demonstrate several features of AWS IoT and related services for practical use cases.

The demo software for these models is in a seperate repo [here](https://github.com/KevinOleniczak/Windfarm-software)

### What's included:
This demo windfarm contains several model elements that help you experience the interactions between a turbine and a monitoring station on the edge. Connectivity with the AWS Cloud is not required to observe a safety assessment that is performed with real data that published continually from the turbine.
